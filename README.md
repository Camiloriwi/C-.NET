TypeScript Examples Project
This project includes examples of how to use TypeScript to represent products, bank accounts, and verify if a string is a palindrome. Below are descriptions of the different components of the project.

1. Interface to Represent a Product
This code defines a Product interface to represent a product with the following attributes:

name (string): The name of the product.
price (number): The price of the product.
category (string): The category of the product.
The ProductImplementado class implements the Product interface and allows creating product objects. An example usage:


const myProduct: Product = new ProductImplementado("T-shirt", 29.999, "Clothing");
console.log(`name: ${myProduct.name}, price: $${myProduct.price}, category: ${myProduct.category}`);
2. Class to Represent a Bank Account
The CuentaBancaria class allows representing a bank account with the following attributes:

numeroCuenta (string): The account number.
saldo (number): The account balance.
titular (string): The account holder.
Additionally, the class includes the following methods:

depositar(amount: number): Allows depositing an amount of money into the account.
retirar(amount: number): Allows withdrawing an amount of money from the account if there are sufficient funds.
consultarSaldo(): Returns the current account balance.
An example usage:


const cuenta1 = new CuentaBancaria("123456", 100000, "Juan Pérez");
const cuenta2 = new CuentaBancaria("987654", 50000, "María Gómez");

cuenta1.deposit(20000);
cuenta2.withdraw(1000);
console.log(`Balance of ${cuenta1.titular}: $${cuenta1.consultarSaldo()}`);
console.log(`Balance of ${cuenta2.titular}: $${cuenta2.consultarSaldo()}`);
3. Function to Check if a String is a Palindrome
The esPalindromo function checks if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces and capitalization.

Example usage:


const exampleOne = "Anita lava la tina";
const exampleTwo = "reconocer";
console.log(`"${exampleOne}" is a palindrome: ${esPalindromo(exampleOne)}`);
4. TypeScript and Node.js Configuration
The project uses TypeScript to write the code and Node.js to run it. Here are some commands you can use to work with the project:

start: Starts the application using nodemon to monitor changes in files.
build: Compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript.
dev: Compiles the index.js file.
The package.json file contains the dependencies and configurations needed to run the project. Make sure to install the dependencies before running any command.
